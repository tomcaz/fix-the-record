# Tamper Proof Data

At Bequest, we require that important user data is tamper proof. Otherwise, our system can incorrectly distribute assets if our internal server or database is breached. 

**1. How does the client ensure that their data has not been tampered with?**
<br />
**2. If the data has been tampered with, how can the client recover the lost data?**


Edit this repo to answer these two questions using any technologies you'd like, there any many possible solutions. Feel free to add comments.

### To run the apps:
